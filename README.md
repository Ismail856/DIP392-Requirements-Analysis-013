How to play:
1. Starting the Game:
- Run the Python script. This will open a window titled "Connect Four".
- The game board will be displayed as a blue grid with white circles representing empty slots.
2. Understanding the Interface:
- The board consists of 7 columns and 6 rows.
- There is a menu bar at the top with options: File and Points.
3. Making a Move:
- The game starts with Player One (Red) making the first move.

- Player Two (Yellow) will take the next turn.
4. Winning the Game:
- The objective is to connect four of your pieces vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
- The game checks for a winning move after each turn. If a player connects four pieces, a message box will pop up declaring the winner.
- The winning player will have their score incremented by one, which can be viewed in the Points menu.
5. Game Over:
- Once a player wins, the game is over, and no more moves can be made.
-  start a new game, go to the File menu and select "New Game". This will reset the board but keep the scores.
